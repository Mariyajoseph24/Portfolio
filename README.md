# Portfolio
My Portfolio is a static website. Every job seeker should have a Portfolio so that the HR or the Recruiter will get an overall idea about the candidate by checking their portfolio.n this project, we use HTML and CSS as computer languages. The platform used is Visual studio and for cloud service, Microsoft Azure is used. Candidate can highlight their skills, projects they have done, and their contact information for the ease of the recruiter. Portfolios are the best way to get a first impression from a recruiter. This project will be useful for many fresh graduate students this is based on the Ed-Tech industry.
